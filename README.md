# App-Build-GenAI
Bild a webapp using GenAI
Here is a design for a GenAI application:

A Global Load Balancer (frontend and backend) to handle user traffic.
A Frontend Service (Cloud Run) for the user interface.
A Retrieval Service (Cloud Run) for the core AI logic.
A PostgreSQL Database for the private knowledge base.
Vertex AI for the large language models.
Secret Manager for storing database credentials.

Here are the high-level implementation steps for your GenAI application design:

Set up the infrastructure:
Create a PostgreSQL instance using Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.
Configure Secret Manager to store the database credentials.
Create two Cloud Run services: one for the frontend and one for the retrieval service.
Configure Vertex AI access.
Create a Global Load Balancer.
Configure the connections:
Configure the Global Load Balancer to route traffic to the frontend Cloud Run service.
Configure the frontend Cloud Run service to communicate with the retrieval Cloud Run service.
Configure the retrieval Cloud Run service to communicate with Vertex AI and PostgreSQL.
Configure the retrieval Cloud Run service to access the database credentials from Secret Manager.
Deploy the application code:
Write and deploy the code for the frontend service.
Write and deploy the code for the retrieval service, including the logic for interacting with Vertex AI and PostgreSQL.
Test and monitor the application:
Test the application thoroughly to ensure it is working as expected.
Set up monitoring to track the application's performance and identify any issues.
